# personal site
I've had a few revisions on personal sites, and most of them have gone down lol. Though, over time I've gotten better at web design, I've learned how to use git better, and I've learned a lot more about resonsive design. So, I bring you; <b>my personal site 3.0!</b>

I'm still relatively new to use git, so I might accidently take the site down when trying to push a change lol :)
